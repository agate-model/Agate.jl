In addition to plankton, the constructor implements idealized detritus (D) and nutrient (N) cycling by default, although more complex N and D cycling can also be defined using the nutrient_dynamics and detritus_dynamics arguments.\n\nDuring model construction, the size of each plankton determines photosynthetic growth rates, nutrient half saturation constants, predation rates, and optionally predator-prey assimilation and palatability values. Alternatively, if manually defined predator-prey assimilation and palatability values are desired, these can be defined using the palatability_matrix and assimilation_efficiency_matrix arguments.\n\nNote that if non-default *_dynamics expressions are passed, the relevant *_args also need to be specified.\n\nArguments\n\nn_phyto: number of phytoplankton to include in the model\nn_zoo: number of zooplankton to include in the model\nnutrient_dynamics: expression describing how nutrients change over time\ndetritus_dynamics: expression describing how detritus evolves over time\nphyto_dynamics: expression describing how phytoplankton grow\nzoo_dynamics: expression describing how zooplankton grow\nphyto_args: Dictionary of phytoplankton parameters\nzoo_args: Dictionary of zooplankton parameters\ninteraction_args: Dictionary of arguments from which a palatability and assimilation  efficiency matrix between all plankton can be computed\nbgc_args: biogeochemistry parameters related to nutrient and detritus\npalatability_matrix: optional palatability matrix passed as a NamedArray, if provided  then paralatability_args are ignored\nassimilation_efficiency_matrix: optional assimilation efficiency matrix passed as a  NamedArray, if provided then assimilation_args are ignored\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"api/#Low-level-API","page":"API","title":"Low level API","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"api/","page":"API","title":"API","text":"Agate.Models.Biogeochemistry.define_tracer_functions","category":"page"},{"location":"api/#Agate.Models.Biogeochemistry.define_tracer_functions","page":"API","title":"Agate.Models.Biogeochemistry.define_tracer_functions","text":"define_tracer_functions(\n    parameters,\n    tracers;\n    auxiliary_fields=[:PAR],\n    helper_functions=nothing,\n    sinking_tracers=nothing,\n    grid=nothing,\n    open_bottom=false,\n) -> DataType\n\nCreate an Oceananigans.Biogeochemistry model type.\n\nArguments\n\nparameters: named sequence of values of the form ((<field name> = <default value>, ...)\ntracers: dictionary of the form (<name> => <expression>, ...)\n\nKeywords\n\nauxiliary_fields: an iterable of auxiliary field variables, defaults to [:PAR,]\nhelper_functions: optional path to a file of helper functions used in tracer expressions\nsinking_tracers: optional NamedTuple of sinking speeds (passed as positive values) of  the form (<tracer name> = <speed>, ...)\ngrid: optional Oceananigans grid object defining the geometry to build the model on, must  be passed if sinking_tracers is defined\nopen_bottom: indicates whether the sinking velocity should be smoothly brought to zero  at the bottom to prevent the tracers leaving the domain, defaults to true, which means  the bottom is open and the tracers leave (i.e., no slowing of velocity to 0 is applied)\n\nNote that the field names defined in parameters can't be any of [:x, :y, :z, :t], as these are reserved for coordinates, and they must include all parameters used in the tracers expressions.
